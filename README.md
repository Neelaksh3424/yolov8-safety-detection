# ðŸ¦º Safety Equipment Detection with YOLOv8

This project uses YOLOv8 to detect safety gear like helmets, vests, and people in images. It's built for the Microsoft Hackathon to promote workplace safety using AI.

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset

We used the Safety Gear Detection dataset from Roboflow:
- Classes: helmet, vest, person
- Format: YOLOv8
- Source: [Roboflow Safety Dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/roboflow-jvuqo/safety-gear-detection)

## ðŸ”§ Installation
